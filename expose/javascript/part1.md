Part 1:

1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. ERROR! --> We used the let keyword to declare the result variable, so it can only be accessed within the block it is defined in. Thus, line 13 returns an error because it can't access the result variable declared at line 5 in the if statement.
5. ERROR! --> We used the const keyword to declare the result variable, so it cannot be reassigned after it is assigned for the first time. Thus, we get an error at line 7 because we attempt to reassign the const result variable, which has already been assigned to 0.
6. ERROR! --> (Same reason as question 5). We used the const keyword to declare the result variable, so it cannot be reassigned after it is assigned for the first time. Thus, we get an error at line 7 because we attempt to reassign the const result variable, which has already been assigned to 0.
